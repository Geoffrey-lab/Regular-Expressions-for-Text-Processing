# Regular-Expressions-for-Text-Processing
This repository contains a Jupyter notebook titled "Regular Expressions" which demonstrates the application of regular expressions for text processing tasks. The notebook provides Python code examples utilizing the re module to perform various text manipulation operations.
Notebook Contents:
Sentence Splitting:
The notebook demonstrates how to split a paragraph into individual sentences using regular expressions. It showcases the use of re.split() function to split text based on sentence boundaries.

Land Area Extraction:
It illustrates how to extract references to land area in a text by identifying numbers followed by the term "acres" using a compiled regular expression pattern.

Species Name Recognition:
The notebook showcases the compilation of a regex pattern to find occurrences of species names formatted as 'Genus Species' in a text. It highlights the use of word boundaries and character classes to match species names.

Plant Extraction:
Demonstrates how to extract specific plant names (oak, maple, pine) from a text related to sustainable land management using a compiled regex pattern with the re.IGNORECASE flag.

Dependencies:
Python 3.x
Jupyter Notebook
re module (standard library)

Feedback and Contributions:
Feel free to provide feedback or contribute to the repository through pull requests or by raising issues. Your contributions are welcomed and appreciated to improve the functionality and usability of the regular expressions for text processing tasks.
